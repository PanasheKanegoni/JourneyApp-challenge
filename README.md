This is a simple javascript application that searches for the top javascript coders in Cape Town.

Before running the code you must make sure that you install the following module:
1. Request module using the command: npm install request.
2. Json module: npm install json.

I run the following code on the ide on my laptop and an online ide and got the correct output for both.
In the pragram I set the timer to wait for 60 seconds. This is to make sure that all of the processes have completed before printing out the final result. Without the inclusion of the setTimer method, some results were printed out without completing fully so the output would be undefined. I have put commits in my code, so hopefully it will be easy to understand.

How to run
1. Simply run application in an IDE of your choice or run in the command line or an online editor.
