This is a simple javascript application that searches for the top javascript coders in Cape Town.

Before running the code you must make sure that you install the following module:
1. Request module using the command: npm install request-promise.
2. Json module: npm install json.

I used promises instead of callbacks as I found them to be more efficient and easier to understand. 

How to run
1. Simply run application in an IDE of your choice or run in the command line or use an online editor.
